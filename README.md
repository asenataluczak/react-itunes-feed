2. Allow the user to see more information about a selected album
3. Allow the user to search through albums by album's and artist's name
4. Allow the user to filter albums by genre and price
5. For every album present how much its position shifted since the last update

### Non-functional

1. Dark mode/Light mode
2. Responsive design
